Code Review Comments:

5. It's very good that you have a desire to add comments to js functions to explain what they do. Just make sure you make it in a standardised way, something along the lines of: https://medium.com/4thought-studios/documenting-javascript-projects-f72429da2eea

6. Approach in lines 26-33 works, but seems a bit too complex. Might be easier to create a const object which would hold number of seconds per yeah, month, day, hour, etc.
Then you can write a function that takes a number of seconds, a unit - and returns a number of units in the number and the number of seconds leftover.
For example:
myFunction(92571231, 'years')
-> { years: 2, seconds: 29491231  }
myFunction(29491231, 'months')
-> { months: 11, seconds: 28831 }
Then you can call this function recursively to get the result.

10. Ternary operator will save you quite a few lines in the pluralisation code. Bonus points if you combine it with string interpolation to insert either 's' or '' at the end of the string.
