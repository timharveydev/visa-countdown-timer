This is a relatively simple countdown timer that I made for my fiance, Gosia, in an effort to improve my Javascript skills. It counts down the time until she can apply for UK citizenship.

It features a dynamic welcome message that varies depending on the time of day, the countdown timer itself and a quote of the day section (which refreshes each time the page reloads).

I did my best to keep the design clean and simple, yet modern, to allow more more time to focus on the Javascript. I've done my best to adhere to ES6 standards and to keep the code clean, efficient and well documented.
